			This form is presented to the user where this can choose 
			the <strong> word's lemma (1)</strong> and <strong>POS (2)</strong> and 
			also the <strong>association measure (3)</strong>. 
			However, the user can still choose some additional options 
			like <strong>the minimum frequency</strong> of each 
			co-occurrence and the <strong>maximum number of words</strong> 
			in each dependency-property pattern. 
			The button <strong>Search (6)</strong> show the result for the lemma searched.

	  		The image shows an example with a set of co-occurrences detected for the 
	  		<strong>noun</strong> <strong>"pa√≠s"</strong>. 
	  		The association measure selected for this result was <strong>LogDice</strong>.
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  		When the word has a result, this is presented in two groups: word to the left and word to the right with whom it co-occurs. For each dependency-property pattern in which the target word is 	involved, the words that co-occur with the target word are presented in descending order of the selected association measure value.  
			Each word that co-occurs is displayed in the format <strong>lemma (l:m)</strong>, where <strong>l</strong> is the base 2 logarithm of the co-occurrence's frequency, and <strong>m</strong> the value of the selected measure. 
			The user may change the association measure without having to re-entering the information about the current word.
	  	</p>

	  		In the result, it is possible to ask for more information about a specific co-occurrence. By clicking on a word present in the result, the server is queried for a set of sentences in which this word occurred. 
			As a result the user is presented the details of this co-occurrence and the set of sentences that exemplify the co-occurrence in the corpus.
