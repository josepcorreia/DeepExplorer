	  	<p>The analysis of the co-occurrence patterns between words allows due to better understand the use (and meaning) of words its most straightforward application are lexicography and linguist description in general.

	  	<a href="#/">DeepString</a> - Syntax Deep Explorer, based on the output of the natural language processing chain <a href="https://string.l2f.inesc-id.pt/w/index.php/Main_Page"> STRING</a>, is a tool that allows to obtain an easy and efficient access to co-occurrence data obtained from Portuguese texts.

	  		The XIP syntactic dependencies analysed in this project are: 
			<ul>
	  			<li><strong>SUBJ</strong> dependency: links a verb and its subject;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CDIR</strong> dependency: links a verb and its direct complement;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CINDIR</strong>  dependency: links the verb with a prepositional phrase;</li>
	  			<li><strong>MOD</strong>  dependency: links a modifier with the modified element;</li>
	  			<li><strong>COMPL</strong>  dependency: links a predicate (verb, noun or adjective) to each of its essential complements;</li>
	  			<li><strong>QUANTD</strong>  dependency:links a nominal head and a quantifier;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CLASSD</strong>  dependency: links a nominal head and a nominal classifier.</li>
			</ul>

			A semantic dependency, Named Entity (NE), was also considered. This dependency delimits named entities and assigns them to several general categories.

			The co-occurrences extraction from a processed corpus by STRING, finds and stores the patterns in a database. Then, for each co-occurrence are calculated the different association measures to quantify them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The web application provides to users an interface that allows to exploit these co-occurrence patterns.
