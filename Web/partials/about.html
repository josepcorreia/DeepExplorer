	  		<a href="#/">DeepString</a> - Syntax Deep Explorer, based on the output of the natural language processing chain <a href="https://string.l2f.inesc-id.pt/w/index.php/Main_Page"> STRING</a>, is a tool that allows to obtain an easy and efficient access to co-occurrence data obtained from Portuguese texts.

			The co-occurrences extraction from a processed corpus by STRING, finds and stores the patterns in a database. Then, for each co-occurrence are calculated the different association measures to quantify them.

	  		The XIP syntactic dependencies analysed in this project are:

			<ul>
	  			<li><strong>SUBJ</strong>: links a verb and its subject;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CDIR</strong>: links a verb and its direct complement;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CINDIR</strong>: links the verb with a prepositional phrase;</li>
	  			<li><strong>MOD</strong>: links a modifier with the modified element;</li>
	  			<li><strong>COMPL</strong>: links a predicate (verb, noun or adjective) to each of its essential complements;</li>
	  			<li><strong>QUANTD</strong>: links a nominal head and a quantifier;</li>
	  			<li><strong>CLASSD</strong>: links a nominal head and a nominal classifier.</li>
			</ul>

			A semantic dependency, Named Entity (NE), was also considered. This dependency delimits named entities and assigns them to several general categories. The categories used in this system are presented in the following table.
